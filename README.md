# Sample policies for OPA using Gatekeeper


## Every pod/namespace must have a set of labels

Make it mandatory for every pod/namespace to be deployed with a set of labels. 

## Control a specific pod/namespace label

Enable a set of users to assign a specific label to the pods/namespaces in the cluster. Prevent others from using that label.
